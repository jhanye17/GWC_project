      <p>Is AI something you've experienced before? If so, you have begun to realize that AI is becoming increasingly involved in our daily lives. Perhaps you’ve used AI at work, school, at home, or even on the go. AI is everywhere, with its fast improvement and accuracy being impressive, and has shown to improve work methods, medical research, and even in security in some cases. But when does AI start to become concerning or even dangerous to our community?</p>  
      <br>
      <p>Have you ever wondered about the safety when it comes to AI? There is so much access to it that it can cause concerning and possibly even devastating events in our community. We’re aware that there have been many cases of AI scams, overlooked privacy violations, large corporation misuse, and even drastic integrity issues. But do you ever think of the people who are affected by this?
