       <h1>The Need for AI Regulations and Laws</h1> 
      
</header> 
    <br>
      <p>Is AI something you've experienced before? If so, you have begun to realize that AI is becoming increasingly involved in our daily lives. Perhaps you’ve used AI at work, school, at home, or even on the go. AI is everywhere, with its fast improvement and accuracy being impressive, it has shown to improve work methods, medical research, and even security in some cases. But when does AI start to become concerning or even dangerous to our community?</p>  
      <br>
      <p>Have you ever wondered about the safety when it comes to AI? There is so much access to it that it can cause concerning and possibly even devastating events in our community. We’re aware that there have been many cases of AI scams, overlooked privacy violations, large corporation misuse, and even drastic integrity issues. But do you ever think of the people who are affected by this?

      <h1 class="risks">The Risks of Unregulated AI</h1>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>AI-powered scams: More than 1 in 4 people (26%) say they - or someone they know - have been approached by an AI chatbot posing as a real person on a dating app or social media (Dhaliwal).</li> 
        <br>  
        <li> Facial recognition technology, which has been shown to have higher error rates for people of color, particularly Black women. This has led to false identifications and wrongful arrests. Similarly, AI hiring algorithms have been found to discriminate against female candidates when trained on historically biased data from male-dominated industries.(What is AI Bias? - Understanding Its Impact, Risks, and Mitigation Strategies)</li>  
        <br> 
        <li>the professional networking site LinkedIn faced backlash after some users noticed they were automatically opted into allowing their data to train generative AI models (Gomstyn and Jonker).</li> 
      </ol>   
      <br>
      <h1>Can this affect you?</h1> 
      <br>
      <p>Imagine being unjustly arrested because of AI inaccuracies, or being discriminated against by AI because it is biased, or discovering big corporations are using your personal information without consent.
